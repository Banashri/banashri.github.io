	<h1>Books</h1>


	<p>I love things - and no wonder, I consider books as my best friend. I bring a suitcase full of books each time I visit my parents' place. ;)
  </p>

  <p> This year I have plans for reading some classics of the 19th century. </p>
  <p>In my list, I have these.
		<ul class="books">
			<li>The Brothers Karamazov [<em>finished</em>]</li>
    	<li>Anna Karenina - <em>ongoing</em></li>
    	<li>War and Peace</li>
    	<li>The Idiot - <em>started</em></li>
    	<li>Moby Dick</li>
    	<li>Divine Comedy</li>
    	<li>The Bleak House</li>
    	<li>Crime and Punishment</li>
    	<li>Great Expectations</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

 <p>In case, I get exhausted by reading so many thick books, I would include these in between. **1984** and **Sense and Sensibilities**.
	 Let's see how it goes. </p>
