	<h1>Books</h1>

	
	<p>I love things - and no wonder, I consider books as my best friend. I bring a suitcase full of books each time I visit my parents' place. ;)
  </p> 
  
  <p> This year I have plans for reading some classics of the 19th century. </p>
  <p>In my list, I have these.
    * The Brothers Karamazov [<em>finished</em>]
    * Anna Karenina - <em>ongoing</em>
    * War and Peace
    * The Idiot - <em>started</em>
    * Moby Dick
    * Divine Comedy
    * The Bleak House
    * Crime and Punishment
    * Great Expectations 
  
 <p>In case, I get exhausted by reading so many thick books, I would include these in between. **1984** and **Sense and Sensibilities**. 
	 Let's see how it goes.
