## Mistakes

#### Too much reviews (29.01.2021)
Being intimidated by the volume of `Anna Karenina` I tried to read as much information as possible to tackle this huge
book. I got some good suggestions, like reading 4 chapters each day. But I spent a bit more time on `reddit` on this book and one post revealed the whole story with spoiler alert. I was so shocked that out of more curiosity I watched
the movie based on the book, released in 2012, on a lazy weekend. I am annoyed, due to the fact that Anna in my imagination
is more beautiful and real than any movie-star in the world. ;)

Tolstoy is God and I cannot miss his masterpiece even knowing how this great novel would proceed.

#### Too much excitement (31.01.2021)
After finishing the book `The Brothers Karamazov`, I declare that this is the best book one can ever read. Indeed, out of all books of Dostoevsky in my collection, I chose this as the first, based on the suggestion from reddit group and I do not regret my decision. This is a real masterpiece and I want to read it again (*wow, that's rare*!).

My reading experience was also full of drama like the content of the book. I barely could control my patience nearing the
climax. This time too, I read beforehand what was the crucial point of the entire novel. Although it did not kill the joy of reading, but made me severely impatient to reach to the climax. :(


## Learnings

- More focus on the journey is needed over the destination.
- Reading thick books promotes mastering the control over own mind, emotions and time. Reading reviews, synopsis are hindrances.
- Track the reading time and improve it slowly daily.
- Make hand-written notes.

Lastly, **get back to reading!** ;)
