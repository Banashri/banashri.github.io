Books are my best friend. One day I would love to build my own library.

I am very happy and proud of myself after finishing my first year of the journey of <em>becoming a reader</em>. My GoodRead reading challenge was to read 24 books, and I outperformed with 183%. The whole experience was definitely a roller-coaster ride. In that I learned that I am so traditional as a reader, audiobooks are not my cup of tea. My biggest achievement was to read <em>Moby Dick</em>, and hardest read was <em>Paradise Lost</em>.
