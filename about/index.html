	<h1>About</h1>

<p>Hi, I am Banashri - a software Engineer, an avid traveler. I have my interests in various areas particularly in Martial Arts, Music and Mountains. I enjoy attending symphony concerts, hiking in the Nature. I end my day by listening to classical instrumental music. Also, I am picking up my skills in playing Ukulele every day.</p>
<p>I moved to Germany for higher studies and now I work there. I would like to pursue my career in Cloud Computing for the next decade. I challenge myself with algorithmic problem solving, and eventually I came to the realisation that preparing for the Competitive programming is fun.</p>

<p>Am I competitive? I guess, my best work came out of competition with myself. I value peace in life, hence, I'm working more towards bringing more peace in life. 

<p>Not very fond of social networking platforms due to the presence of so much noise. Hence, I refrain from showing off my grandiose belongings or recent acquirements over there. ^-^ </p>

<p>Instead, I engage mostly in reading books, listening to audiobooks, and practicing code.

Nowadays, I am exploring history of the EU and pondering over how I can contribute to any activities related to Climate Change! Hopefully, I will fugure it out soon!</p>
