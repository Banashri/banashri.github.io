	<h1>About</h1>

<p>Hi, I am Banashri. A Software Engineer by profession and an avid traveler. I have my likings in various areas like Martial Arts, Music and Mountains. I enjoy attending symphony concerts, hiking in the Nature. I start and end my day by listening to classical instrumental music. Also, I am picking up my skills in playing Ukulele every day.</p>
<p>I moved to Germany for my studies and now I work there. I found my passion in Cloud Computing and would like to pursue my career in this field. I challenge myself with algorithmic problem solving, and gradually I felt I am finding my interest in solving very interesting common problems in Competitive programming. </p>

<p>Am I competitive? I guess, my best work came out of competition with myself. I believe that peace is the most essential in life and hence, I'm working towards bringing more peace in life. I refrain from showing off my belongings on Facebook. I engage mostly in reading and practicing code.</p>
