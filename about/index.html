	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>I am a Software Engineer. I love Computer Science, Maths, Mountains, and Photography. Being close to Nature is something I desire the most.</a></p>
	
<p>These days I am trying to be a <em>Reader</em>. At the moment, exploring Linear Algebra by reading the book written by Prof. Strang. Trust me, I am loving it a lot.
	Furthermore, getting my hands dirty with dynamic programming. Let's see how it goes.</p>
