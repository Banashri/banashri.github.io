	<h1>About</h1>

<p>Hi, I am Banashri. A Software Engineer by profession and an avid traveler. I have my likings in various areas like Martial Arts, Music and Mountains. I enjoy attending symphony concerts, hiking in the Nature. I start and end my day by listening to classical instrumental music. Also, I am picking up my skills in playing Ukulele every day.</p>
<p>I moved to Germany for my studies and now I work there. I found my passion in Cloud Computing and would like to pursue my career in this field. I challenge myself with algorithmic problem solving, and gradually I felt I am finding my interest in solving very interesting common problems in Competitive programming. </p>

<p>Am I competitive? I guess, my best work came out of competition with myself. I value peace in life, for being the most essential in life and hence, I'm working towards bringing more peace in life. 
Not very fond of social networking platforms for the presence of so much chaos. Hence, I refrain from showing off my grandiose belongings or recent acquirements over there. ^-^
	Instead, I engage mostly in reading books, listening to audiobooks, and practicing code.</p>
