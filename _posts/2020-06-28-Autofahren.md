I resumed my German learning this year again, as I found some need to step into the next level. For 2020, I can say that two things are important. Preparation and Perform.
Being a bit realistist, I think I shall keep on improving my skills on problem solving and mastering the language. The rest is secondary now, as due to Corona crisis, travel is not encouraged by any state and 
this is the time to act wisely.

The Govt extended the deadline of Driving exam by 6 more months luckily. For that, I need to learn some German words realated to Driving and Cars.
