Trie data structure is quiet efficient for string search. Lets see how we can find the ranges of indices in a string where a group of words are found.
Based on this idea many programming problems can be solved.

We have a string : `abcd123xyz` and we want to find range of indices where some words appear given in a set, `set = ["abc", "xy", â€œ23"]`


Base template for `Trie` is here :

```java
class Trie {
  TrieNode root;
  
  public void insert(String word) {
  
  
  }
  
  public int search(String word, int startIndex) {
  
  
  }
}
``` 
Trie can be composed of `TrieNode` which stores the key-value mapping of its immediate `TrieNode`. So, for a string "ab", a trie node is created for `a` value and this node would be having a child trie node with value `b`.
If we have another string `ac`, then `a` trie node would be having another child `c`.

Hope, this is clear. So, lets structure this class.

```java
class TrieNode {
  Map<Character, TrieNode> next;
  boolean isEnd;
  
  TrieNode() {
    next = new HashMap<>();
  }
```
